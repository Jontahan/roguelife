# Roguelife ðŸ’€
The game that both plays and develops itself

More elaborated, this project is about pitting AI agents against a procedural level generator. The level generator will adapt to the player over time. For illustration purposes, we have designed some rule-based agents who use very specific strategies, to see how the generator "responds" to that. For the full experiment, we want to run a learning agent (using a DQN), that will learn to exploit the environment, all while the environment learns to exploit the agent.
